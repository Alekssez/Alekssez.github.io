<span>Study choice</span>
<a  class="blog-title">Why I chose this program</a>
<p>Information technology is one of the hottest topics these days. I chose this program first because I like to spend my time in front of the computer and I'm also quite interested in coding. I liked this program at HZ University the most because it will teach me everything related to coding, also because the city is beautiful and peaceful.</p>

<a class="blog-title">My programming experience</a>
<p>Before I came to this university, I had almost nothing to do with programming. In school, whatever classes we had and that's it. I didn't go to additional courses that are offered almost everywhere. Now I'm very motivated and want to learn a lot about programming.</p>

<a class="blog-title">My first feedback</a>
<p>Hello Aleks, welcom to our program! I have written down some notes and feedback about your "who am I" document. Don't worry about answering all of that just yet. Just keep it in mind for your first website and your further personal development.
Great to hear about your motivation for computers and coding. I am curious which part of these subjects makes you so interested in it. Also there are many other IT programs in the Netherlands. What made you choose HBO-ICT at the HZ University?
Don't worry about not knowing exactly what you want to do after the study. Like you said you still have a lot of time to think about it. Also during your study you will learn a lot about the field of IT. This will help you make a more informed decission later on.
Good to see you easily get along with your team. You will be working in teams a lot during this study so that will help. 
Kind regards,
Gijs van den Abeele</p>
